	<div class="deskripsi">
	<p>A passionate beginner in digital media with a growing track record and a deep interest in visual storytelling. Since 2020, I’ve been actively involved in digital media communities—constantly learning, sharing, and collaborating. My journey began with curiosity, and over time I’ve explored and developed skills in 3D, design, photography, UI design, and motion graphics. <br><br>Along the way, I’ve had the opportunity to work on freelance projects, intern at NusaEdu, and contribute as a design division member in a student organization for over a year. These experiences have helped me better understand creative workflows, teamwork, and the value of continuous learning. Currently, I'm still learning and experimenting with tools like Blender, Figma, Adobe Creative Cloud, and other creative software—always open to feedback and excited to keep growing through new challenges and collaborations.</p>
